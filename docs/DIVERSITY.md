## 1. Overview and Introduction

### What is Population Diversity

Population diversity refers to the genetic variation within the evolutionary algorithm's population. In the context of image collage generation, this means having individuals (tile arrangements) that differ significantly from each other in terms of:
- **Tile placement patterns**
- **Spatial arrangements**
- **Local neighborhood structures**
- **Overall composition strategies**

### Why Diversity Matters

Population diversity is essential for:
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation Balance**: Maintaining ability to explore new solution regions
- **Local Optima Escape**: Preventing entrapment in suboptimal solutions
- **Sustained Evolution**: Keeping genetic material available for continued improvement
- **Robust Solutions**: Finding solutions that work across different problem variations

### Key Principles

- **Measure Diversity**: Use multiple metrics to assess population state
- **Adaptive Control**: Adjust algorithm behavior based on diversity levels
- **Multiple Strategies**: Combine complementary diversity preservation techniques
- **Problem-Aware**: Leverage domain knowledge for effective diversity measures

---

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### Exploration vs. Exploitation Balance

The fundamental challenge in evolutionary computation is balancing exploration of new solution regions with exploitation of known good solutions. Diversity preservation techniques help maintain this balance by:

1. **Exploration Enhancement**: Keeping population spread across solution space
2. **Premature Convergence Prevention**: Avoiding early fixation on suboptimal solutions
3. **Adaptive Pressure Management**: Adjusting selection pressure based on population state

### Genetic Diversity Concepts

#### Hamming Distance
Measures genetic differences between individuals by counting differing positions:
```
Individual 1: [1, 3, 5, 2, 4]
Individual 2: [1, 7, 5, 8, 4]
Hamming Distance: 2 (positions 1 and 3 differ)
```

#### Shannon Entropy
Quantifies information content and randomness in population:
- Higher entropy = more diverse population
- Lower entropy = more converged population

#### Genetic Clustering
Groups similar individuals to understand population structure and identify dominant patterns.

### Convergence Theory

#### Types of Convergence
- **Genetic Convergence**: Population becomes genetically uniform
- **Fitness Convergence**: Fitness values become similar
- **Spatial Convergence**: Solutions cluster in specific regions of solution space

#### Convergence Indicators
- Decreasing Hamming distances
- Reducing fitness variance
- Increasing genetic clustering
- Stagnating fitness improvement

### Multi-Modal Optimization

Many optimization problems have multiple optimal or near-optimal solutions. Diversity preservation helps:
- **Maintain Multiple Peaks**: Keep solutions on different fitness peaks
- **Avoid Single-Peak Fixation**: Prevent population collapse to one optimum
- **Enable Peak Switching**: Allow transitions between different solution regions

### ‚úÖ Island Model Implementation

The island model provides population structure through multiple isolated populations with periodic migration:

```python
class IslandPopulationManager:
    def __init__(self, num_islands: int = 4, island_size: int = 50,
                 migration_rate: float = 0.1, migration_interval: int = 10):
        self.num_islands = num_islands
        self.islands = [Population(size=island_size) for _ in range(num_islands)]
        self.migration_rate = migration_rate
        self.migration_interval = migration_interval

    def evolve_generation(self):
        """Evolve all islands independently, then migrate."""
        # Evolve each island
        for island in self.islands:
            island.evolve_one_generation()

        # Periodic migration
        if self.generation % self.migration_interval == 0:
            self.migrate_individuals()

    def migrate_individuals(self):
        """Exchange individuals between islands."""
        num_migrants = int(self.migration_rate * self.islands[0].size)

        for i, source_island in enumerate(self.islands):
            target_island_idx = (i + 1) % self.num_islands
            target_island = self.islands[target_island_idx]

            # Select best individuals for migration
            migrants = source_island.get_best_individuals(num_migrants)

            # Replace worst individuals in target island
            target_island.replace_worst_individuals(migrants)
```

## 5. Advanced Features

### Diversity-Preserving Operators

#### Smart Mutation Strategies

**Adaptive Mutation Rates**
```python
class AdaptiveMutationManager:
    def update_mutation_rate(self, diversity_metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> float:
        """Adjust mutation rate based on population diversity."""
        diversity_score = diversity_metrics.get('normalized_diversity', 0.5)

        if diversity_score < 0.2:
            # Very low diversity - increase mutation significantly
            self.current_rate = min(self.max_rate, self.current_rate * 1.5)
        elif diversity_score < 0.4:
            # Low diversity - increase mutation moderately
            self.current_rate = min(self.max_rate, self.current_rate * 1.2)
        elif diversity_score > 0.8:
            # High diversity - can reduce mutation
            self.current_rate = max(self.min_rate, self.current_rate * 0.9)

        return self.current_rate
```

**Distance-Based Mutation**
- Mutates toward unexplored regions of solution space
- Calculates average distance to population for each position
- Biases mutation toward positions with high uniqueness

**Multi-Point Guided Mutation**
- Performs multiple mutations guided by population patterns
- Identifies common patterns and biases away from them
- Promotes rare genetic combinations

#### Diversity-Aware Crossover

**Dissimilar Parent Selection**
```python
def select_dissimilar_parents(population: List[np.ndarray], fitness_scores: List[float],
                             diversity_weight: float = 0.3) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """Select parents that are both fit and genetically diverse."""

    def combined_score(idx1: int, idx2: int) -> float:
        # Fitness component (lower is better)
        fitness_component = (fitness_scores[idx1] + fitness_scores[idx2]) / 2

        # Diversity component (higher Hamming distance is better)
        hamming_dist = np.sum(population[idx1] != population[idx2])
        max_possible_dist = len(population[idx1])
        diversity_component = hamming_dist / max_possible_dist

        # Combined score (lower is better, so subtract diversity)
        return fitness_component - diversity_weight * diversity_component
```

**Multi-Parent Crossover**
- Creates offspring by combining genetic material from multiple parents
- Biases toward less common values among parents
- Promotes genetic diversity in offspring

### Explicit Diversity Maintenance

#### Diversity-Based Replacement Strategies

**Crowding Replacement**
```python
class CrowdingReplacement:
    def replace_individual(self, population: List[np.ndarray], fitness_scores: List[float],
                          new_individual: np.ndarray, new_fitness: float) -> int:
        """Replace most similar individual rather than worst."""

        # Find most similar individual to new_individual
        min_distance = float('inf')
        most_similar_idx = 0

        for i, individual in enumerate(population):
            distance = np.sum(individual != new_individual)
            if distance < min_distance:
                min_distance = distance
                most_similar_idx = i

        # Replace if new individual is better than most similar
        if new_fitness < fitness_scores[most_similar_idx]:
            return most_similar_idx
        else:
            # Fall back to worst replacement
            return fitness_scores.index(max(fitness_scores))
```

**Fitness Sharing**
- Adjusts fitness based on local population density
- Reduces fitness of individuals in crowded regions
- Promotes exploration of sparsely populated areas

### Restart and Injection Strategies

#### Intelligent Restart Mechanisms
```python
class IntelligentRestartManager:
    def should_restart(self, diversity_score: float, current_best_fitness: float) -> bool:
        """Determine if population should be restarted."""

        # Check diversity-based restart
        if diversity_score < self.diversity_threshold:
            return True

        # Check stagnation-based restart
        if len(self.best_fitness_history) >= self.stagnation_threshold:
            recent_improvement = (
                self.best_fitness_history[-self.stagnation_threshold] -
                self.best_fitness_history[-1]
            )
            if recent_improvement < 0.001:  # Minimal improvement threshold
                return True

        return False
```

#### Adaptive Immigration Policies
- Injects new individuals to increase diversity
- Adapts immigration rate based on population state
- Generates immigrants targeting underexplored regions

### Advanced Techniques

#### Speciation and Niching
```python
class SpeciationManager:
    def organize_species(self, population: List[np.ndarray],
                        fitness_scores: List[float]) -> List[List[int]]:
        """Group population into species based on genetic similarity."""
        # Groups similar individuals into species
        # Applies fitness sharing within species
        # Maintains species diversity across generations
```

#### Multi-Objective Diversity Maintenance
- Treats diversity as a secondary optimization objective
- Uses Pareto dominance for selection
- Balances fitness improvement with diversity preservation

---

## 6. Problem-Specific Strategies

### Spatial Diversity for Image Collages

#### Local Pattern Analysis
The system analyzes local tile patterns to understand spatial diversity:

```python
def _calculate_local_pattern_entropy(self, population: List[np.ndarray]) -> float:
    """Calculate entropy of local 2x2 patterns."""
    pattern_counts = {}

    for individual in population:
        grid = individual.reshape(self.grid_height, self.grid_width)

        # Extract all 2x2 patterns
        for y in range(self.grid_height - 1):
            for x in range(self.grid_width - 1):
                pattern = tuple(grid[y:y+2, x:x+2].flatten())
                pattern_counts[pattern] = pattern_counts.get(pattern, 0) + 1

    # Calculate Shannon entropy
    total_patterns = sum(pattern_counts.values())
    entropy = 0
    for count in pattern_counts.values():
        if count > 0:
            prob = count / total_patterns
            entropy -= prob * math.log2(prob)

    return entropy
```

#### Spatial-Aware Mutation
- Identifies regions with low spatial diversity
- Biases mutation toward positions that increase local diversity
- Considers neighbor relationships when selecting new tiles

### Multi-Modal Fitness Management

#### Component-Specific Diversity
```python
class MultiModalFitnessManager:
    def maintain_component_diversity(self, population: List[np.ndarray],
                                   component_fitness_scores: Dict[str, List[float]]) -> Dict[str, float]:
        """Maintain diversity in each fitness component separately."""

        for component in self.fitness_components:
            scores = component_fitness_scores[component]

            # Calculate component-specific diversity
            component_diversity = np.var(scores) / (np.mean(scores) ** 2) if np.mean(scores) > 0 else 0

            # Determine if this component needs diversity boost
            if component_diversity < threshold:
                diversity_adjustments[component] = 'increase'
```

#### Balanced Evolution
- Monitors diversity in each fitness component (color, luminance, texture, edges)
- Adjusts selection pressure per component
- Prevents premature convergence in any single fitness aspect

### Tile Arrangement Optimization

#### Spatial Clustering Analysis
- Analyzes similarity patterns in tile neighborhoods
- Identifies regions of high/low spatial clustering
- Promotes diverse spatial arrangements

#### Contiguous Region Detection
- Finds connected areas of similar tiles
- Measures spatial coherence vs. diversity trade-offs
- Guides mutation toward breaking up large uniform regions

            # Low diversity - increase mutation
            new_rate = min(self.parameter_bounds['mutation_rate'][1],
                          self.current_config['mutation_rate'] * 1.3)
            adaptations['mutation_rate'] = new_rate

        # Selection pressure adaptation
        if diversity_score < 0.3:
            # Reduce selection pressure
            new_size = max(self.parameter_bounds['tournament_size'][0],
                          self.current_config['tournament_size'] - 1)
            adaptations['tournament_size'] = new_size
```

#### Adaptive Parameters
- **Mutation Rate**: Increases when diversity drops, decreases when diversity is high
- **Selection Pressure**: Reduced when diversity is low, increased when stagnating
- **Tournament Size**: Adjusted based on diversity and fitness improvement
- **Immigration Rate**: Increased during low diversity periods

#### Performance Optimization
- **Sampling for Large Populations**: O(n¬≤) algorithms use sampling when population > 1000
- **Incremental Calculations**: Diversity updates only when population changes
- **Caching**: Expensive calculations cached between generations
- **Parallel Processing**: Diversity calculations parallelized where possible

## 9. Future Development

### üìã Selection Pressure Management

**Planned Features** - These selection pressure management techniques are documented but not yet implemented:

#### Fitness Scaling Techniques

**Linear Scaling**
```python
def linear_scaling(fitness_scores: List[float], scaling_factor: float = 2.0) -> List[float]:
    """Scale fitness values to control selection pressure."""
    min_fitness = min(fitness_scores)
    max_fitness = max(fitness_scores)

    if max_fitness == min_fitness:
        return [1.0] * len(fitness_scores)

    # Scale so best individual has scaling_factor times average fitness
    avg_fitness = sum(fitness_scores) / len(fitness_scores)

    scaled_scores = []
    for fitness in fitness_scores:
        scaled = avg_fitness + (fitness - avg_fitness) * scaling_factor / (max_fitness - avg_fitness)
        scaled_scores.append(max(0.1, scaled))  # Ensure minimum selection chance

    return scaled_scores
```

**Sigma Scaling**
```python
def sigma_scaling(fitness_scores: List[float], c: float = 2.0) -> List[float]:
    """Normalize fitness based on population standard deviation."""
    mean_fitness = statistics.mean(fitness_scores)
    std_fitness = statistics.stdev(fitness_scores) if len(fitness_scores) > 1 else 1.0

    scaled_scores = []
    for fitness in fitness_scores:
        if std_fitness > 0:
            scaled = 1.0 + (fitness - mean_fitness) / (c * std_fitness)
        else:
            scaled = 1.0
        scaled_scores.append(max(0.1, scaled))

    return scaled_scores
```

**Rank-Based Selection**
- Generates selection weights based on fitness rank rather than absolute values
- Provides more consistent selection pressure across different fitness landscapes

#### Adaptive Selection Pressure
- Automatically adjusts selection pressure based on population diversity
- Reduces pressure when diversity is low, increases when diversity is high
- Maintains balance between exploration and exploitation

- Maintains population diversity while allowing fitness improvement
- Particularly effective in multi-modal optimization problems

#### Fitness Sharing
- Adjusts individual fitness based on local population density
- Reduces fitness of individuals in crowded solution regions
- Promotes exploration of sparsely populated areas

#### Speciation Support
- Groups population into species based on genetic similarity
- Applies fitness sharing within species
- Maintains multiple solution peaks simultaneously
