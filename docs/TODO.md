## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### 7. Performance Optimizations

#### 🔥 **Tile-Based Fitness Caching** - HIGHEST IMPACT OPTIMIZATION
**Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **CRITICAL** - Single biggest performance improvement available
**Impact**: 78% runtime reduction (10.8 days → 2.4 days for large runs)
**Effort**: 10-15 hours implementation
**ROI**: 13:1 - saves 200 hours per run, costs 15 hours to implement

**Problem**:
Current fitness evaluation recomputes all tile comparisons every generation, even though:
- 75% of new individuals (crossover children) inherit 100% of tiles from parents
- 20% of individuals (elites) are unchanged from previous generation
- 5% of individuals (mutations) only change ~5% of tiles
- Result: 85-95% of tile fitness calculations could be cached but aren't

**Solution - Decompose Fitness to Tile Level**:
```python
# Current approach (SLOW):
individual_fitness = evaluate_full_image(assemble_all_tiles(individual))
# Recomputes ALL tile comparisons every time

# Tile-cached approach (FAST):
tile_scores = [cache.get_or_compute(pos, source_id, target[pos])
               for pos, source_id in individual]
individual_fitness = aggregate_cached_tiles(tile_scores)
# 85-95% cache hits after generation 1!
```

**Fitness Component Decomposability**:
- ✅ **Color Similarity (40% weight)**: Perfectly tile-decomposable
  - Per-tile CIEDE2000, aggregate with mean
  - 100% cacheable, zero accuracy loss
- ✅ **Luminance Matching (25% weight)**: Perfectly tile-decomposable
  - Per-tile luminance difference, aggregate with mean
  - 100% cacheable, zero accuracy loss
- ⚠️ **Texture Correlation (20% weight)**: Tile-local approximation
  - Local Binary Patterns per tile
  - 95% cacheable, ~5% accuracy loss (acceptable tradeoff)
- ⚠️ **Edge Preservation (15% weight)**: Hybrid approach needed
  - Cache tile-interior edges (70% of edges)
  - Compute tile-boundary edges fresh (30% of edges)
  - 70% cacheable with boundary correction

**Cache Performance by Generation Phase**:

*Generations 1-50 (low convergence, 75% cache hit)*:
- Speedup: 2.75x (1,372s → 498s per generation)
- Cache saves: Color/luminance mostly cached from parent tiles

*Generations 51-200 (medium convergence, 85% cache hit)*:
- Speedup: 3.6x (1,372s → 381s per generation)
- Population similarity increases, more tile reuse

*Generations 201-679 (high convergence, 95% cache hit)*:
- Speedup: 5.2x (1,372s → 265s per generation)
- Maximum cache efficiency as population converges

**Expected Results** (60×80 grid, 679 generations):
- Current: 931,609s (10.8 days)
- With caching: 210,357s (2.4 days)
- Time saved: 8.4 days per run (78% reduction)

**Memory Requirements**:
- Cache size: 4,800 positions × 500 sources × 16 bytes = 38MB
- Completely manageable, fits easily in RAM

**Implementation Phases**:
1. **Phase 1**: Core tile caching for color/luminance (8 hours)
   - Implement TileFitnessCache class
   - Cache (grid_pos, source_id, target_features) → fitness_components
   - Expected: 62% of fitness computation eliminated
2. **Phase 2**: Texture tile-local approximation (3 hours)
   - Validate correlation with full-image texture (>0.90)
   - Expected: Additional 18% speedup
3. **Phase 3**: Edge hybrid calculation (4 hours)
   - 70% cached tile-interior, 30% boundary computation
   - Expected: Additional 10% speedup

**Validation Strategy**:
- Correlation test: cached fitness vs original fitness (>0.98 required)
- Evolution trajectory comparison: should converge to similar results
- Small run validation (50 gens) before deploying to long runs

**Combined with Other Optimizations**:
- Convergence fix (✅ already implemented): Stop early when converged
- Tile caching: 78% reduction on actual generations run
- **Total potential**: 10.8 days → 1.5 days (86% total reduction)
