# System Debugging Plan - Complete System Restoration

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive debugging approach for the Image Collage Generator, organized by confidence level and system complexity. It assumes you are a new developer with limited knowledge of this system and need to understand both how it should work and how to fix what's broken.

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-21
**Analysis Source**: output_20250920_195522 (500 generation run)
**Context**: Multiple critical systems non-functional despite proper configuration

---

## 📚 **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE PRIMER**

### **How the Image Collage Generator Should Work**

The system uses a **genetic algorithm** to evolve optimal arrangements of source images (tiles) to recreate a target image:

1. **Population**: 150 individuals, each representing a different tile arrangement
2. **Evolution**: Crossover (breeding) and mutation operations create new arrangements
3. **Fitness**: Evaluates how well each arrangement matches the target (color, luminance, texture, edges)
4. **Selection**: Better arrangements have higher chance of breeding
5. **Tracking**: Multiple systems monitor and record the evolution process

### **Major System Components**

#### **Core Systems** (These work correctly ✅):
- **Genetic Algorithm Engine**: Performs evolution, selection, crossover, mutation
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Calculates how well arrangements match target image
- **Diversity Metrics**: Tracks population diversity to prevent premature convergence
- **Diagnostics System**: Collects comprehensive data and generates 13 visualization plots
- **GPU Acceleration**: Uses CUDA for parallel fitness evaluation

#### **Tracking Systems** (These are broken ❌):
- **Lineage Tracking**: Records genealogy (parent-child relationships) of individuals
- **Island Model**: Manages multiple populations with occasional migration
- **Component Tracking**: Tracks individual fitness components (color, texture, etc.)

#### **Performance Systems** (These have issues ⚠️):
- **LRU Cache**: Should speed up repeated image processing operations
- **Intelligent Restart**: Should restart population during stagnation periods

#### **Configuration Systems** (These have bugs 🐛):
- **Directory Naming**: Should use user-configured directory names
- **Alert Thresholds**: Should provide meaningful warnings without excessive false positives
- **Image Geometry**: Should preserve target aspect ratio and grid orientation

### **Expected vs. Actual Behavior Summary**

| System | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Genetic Algorithm** | 500 generations, fitness improvement | 59% improvement achieved | ✅ **Working** |
| **Lineage Tracking** | Record 75K+ births across generations | Only 148 initial births | ❌ **Broken** |
| **Island Model** | 25 migration events (every 20 generations) | 0 migrations | ❌ **Broken** |
| **LRU Cache** | 3x speedup after warmup (62s→20s/gen) | Flat 62s/gen for 490 generations | ❌ **Broken** |
| **Component Tracking** | 3 component visualizations | 0 component visualizations | ❌ **Broken** |
| **Configuration** | Use "lineage_comprehensive" directory | Creates "lineage/" directory | 🐛 **Buggy** |
| **Alerts** | Meaningful warnings | 98% false positive rate | 🐛 **Miscalibrated** |
| **Image Geometry** | 30×40 grid → 960×1280 portrait output | 1280×960 landscape output | 🐛 **Wrong orientation** |

## 🔍 **PHASE 0: SYSTEM UNDERSTANDING AND BASELINE** (4 hours)

### **0.1 Understanding the Working Systems** (90 minutes)
**Objective**: Learn how the genetic algorithm actually works and confirm what's functioning

**Why start here**: You need to understand the working parts before fixing the broken parts.

#### **Step 1: Explore the Core Genetic Algorithm** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Find the main genetic algorithm files
find image_collage/ -name "*genetic*" -o -name "*ga*" | head -10
ls -la image_collage/genetic/
ls -la image_collage/core/

# Look at the main genetic algorithm implementation
head -50 image_collage/genetic/ga_engine.py
head -50 image_collage/core/collage_generator.py
```

**What to look for**:
- Crossover and mutation functions
- Population management
- Selection mechanisms
- Integration points where tracking should happen

#### **Step 2: Understand Fitness Evaluation** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Examine fitness evaluation system
ls -la image_collage/fitness/
head -30 image_collage/fitness/evaluator.py

# Look at fitness components
grep -r "color.*weight\|texture.*weight" image_collage/fitness/ -A 3 -B 3
```

**What to learn**:
- How fitness is calculated (color 35%, luminance 30%, texture 20%, edges 15%)
- Why component tracking should be possible (fitness is already broken into components)
- How fitness guides evolution

#### **Step 3: Examine Working Diagnostics System** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Look at diagnostics implementation
ls -la image_collage/diagnostics/
head -30 image_collage/diagnostics/collector.py

# Check the successful diagnostics output
ls -la output_20250920_195522/diagnostics_comprehensive/
head -5 output_20250920_195522/diagnostics_comprehensive/generation_data.csv
```

**Key insight**: The diagnostics system successfully captures genetic operations data, which proves the GA is working correctly.

### **0.2 Confirm Broken Systems with Minimal Tests** (90 minutes)
**Objective**: Run controlled tests to confirm exactly what's broken vs. working

#### **Step 1: Lineage Tracking Minimal Test** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Run the shortest possible test to check lineage tracking
cd /opt/Projects/ImageCollage

# Create minimal test
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ lineage_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 3 \
  --track-lineage test_lineage/ \
  --verbose

# Check results
echo "=== Lineage Test Results ==="
cat test_lineage/lineage_summary.json
echo "=== Birth Methods ==="
grep '"birth_method"' test_lineage/individuals.json | sort | uniq -c
echo "=== Expected: Should see crossover and mutation births, not just initial ==="
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **Working**: See "crossover" and "mutation" birth methods
- ❌ **Broken**: Only see "initial" birth method

#### **Step 2: Island Model Minimal Test** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Test island model with minimal settings
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ island_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 25 \
  --verbose 2>&1 | tee island_test.log

# Check for island/migration messages
echo "=== Island Model Messages ==="
grep -i "island\|migrat" island_test.log

# Check migration events (should have 1-2 migrations in 25 generations)
echo "=== Migration Events ==="
cat output_*/lineage/migration_events.json
echo "=== Expected: Should see at least 1 migration event ==="
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **Working**: See migration events in JSON file
- ❌ **Broken**: Empty migration events array `[]`

#### **Step 3: Cache Performance Baseline Test** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Test cache performance with timing
echo "=== Cache Performance Test ==="
echo "Testing 10 generations to see if performance improves..."

time image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ cache_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 10 \
  --verbose 2>&1 | tee cache_test.log

# Analyze timing progression
echo "=== Timing Analysis ==="
grep "Runtime:" cache_test.log | tail -5
echo "=== Expected: Should see decreasing runtime after first few generations ==="
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ **Working**: Runtime decreases significantly after generation 2-3
- ❌ **Broken**: Runtime stays flat across all generations

### **0.3 Establish Development Environment and Tools** (60 minutes)
**Objective**: Set up debugging tools and baseline comparison capabilities

#### **Step 1: Create Testing Framework** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create a debugging workspace
mkdir -p debugging_workspace
cd debugging_workspace

# Create test data locations
mkdir -p {lineage_tests,performance_tests,config_tests,baseline_outputs}

# Create reusable test targets and sources (if not already available)
echo "Setting up test data..."
# Copy or symlink small test target and source images for quick testing
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up Comparison Tools** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create comparison scripts for before/after testing
cat > compare_lineage.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Lineage Comparison ==="
echo "Before fix:"
grep '"birth_method"' $1/lineage/individuals.json | sort | uniq -c
echo "After fix:"
grep '"birth_method"' $2/lineage/individuals.json | sort | uniq -c
EOF

cat > compare_performance.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "=== Performance Comparison ==="
echo "Before fix (should be flat):"
grep "Runtime:" $1 | tail -5
echo "After fix (should decrease):"
grep "Runtime:" $2 | tail -5
EOF

chmod +x compare_*.sh
```

## 🚀 **PHASE 1: HIGH-CONFIDENCE FIXES** (8-12 hours)

### **1.1 Fix Lineage Tracking Integration** (4-6 hours)
**Confidence**: 95% - This is clearly a missing integration issue
**Evidence**: GA shows genetic operations happening, but lineage shows none

#### **Understanding the Problem** (30 minutes)
The genetic algorithm is working perfectly:
- 55.7% beneficial mutation rate per generation
- 104.9% beneficial crossover rate per generation
- 11-61 beneficial operations recorded per generation in diagnostics

But lineage tracking shows:
- Only 148 "initial" individuals
- Zero "crossover" or "mutation" births
- No parent-child relationships

**Root Cause**: Lineage tracker exists but isn't connected to genetic operations.

#### **Step 1: Locate Integration Points** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Find where genetic operations happen
grep -r "crossover\|mutation" image_collage/genetic/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5 -B 5

# Find lineage tracker implementation
find image_collage/ -name "*lineage*" -type f
grep -r "class.*Lineage\|def.*record" image_collage/lineage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Look for existing integration attempts
grep -r "lineage.*track\|track.*lineage" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
```

**What to find**:
- Where crossover and mutation functions are called
- What the lineage tracker API looks like (probably `record_birth()` method)
- If there are any existing (but broken) integration attempts

#### **Step 2: Understand Lineage Tracker API** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Study the lineage tracker implementation
cat image_collage/lineage/tracker.py  # or whatever the main file is

# Look for the birth recording method
grep -r "def.*record\|def.*birth\|def.*track" image_collage/lineage/ -A 10

# Check how individuals are represented
grep -r "individual.*id\|id.*individual" image_collage/lineage/ -A 5 -B 5
```

**Key questions to answer**:
- How do you record a birth? `lineage_tracker.record_birth(child, parents, method)`?
- How are individuals identified? By ID, hash, or object reference?
- What birth methods are supported? "crossover", "mutation", "initial"?

#### **Step 3: Find Genetic Operations in GA Engine** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Locate the main evolution loop
grep -r "def.*evolve\|def.*generation" image_collage/genetic/ -A 20

# Find crossover operations
grep -r "def.*crossover" image_collage/genetic/ -A 10
grep -r "crossover" image_collage/core/ -A 5 -B 5

# Find mutation operations
grep -r "def.*mutate" image_collage/genetic/ -A 10
grep -r "mutation" image_collage/core/ -A 5 -B 5
```

**What to locate**:
- The main evolution loop where new individuals are created
- The exact spots where crossover produces children
- The exact spots where mutation creates new individuals
- How parent-child relationships are available

#### **Step 4: Implement Lineage Integration** (2-3 hours)

**Example integration code** (adapt based on actual API):
```python
# In genetic algorithm crossover operation:
def crossover_operation(parent1, parent2):
    child = perform_crossover(parent1, parent2)

    # ADD THIS: Record birth in lineage tracker
    if hasattr(self, 'lineage_tracker') and self.lineage_tracker:
        self.lineage_tracker.record_birth(
            individual=child,
            parents=[parent1, parent2],
            birth_method="crossover",
            generation=self.current_generation
        )

    return child

# In genetic algorithm mutation operation:
def mutation_operation(individual):
    mutated = perform_mutation(individual)

    # ADD THIS: Record birth in lineage tracker
    if hasattr(self, 'lineage_tracker') and self.lineage_tracker:
        self.lineage_tracker.record_birth(
            individual=mutated,
            parents=[individual],
            birth_method="mutation",
            generation=self.current_generation
        )

    return mutated
```

**Files likely to need modification**:
- `image_collage/genetic/ga_engine.py` - Add lineage calls to genetic operations
- `image_collage/core/collage_generator.py` - Ensure lineage tracker is passed to GA engine

#### **Step 5: Test Lineage Fix** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Test fixed lineage tracking
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ lineage_fix_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 5 \
  --track-lineage lineage_fix_test/ \
  --verbose

# Verify fix worked
echo "=== Birth Methods After Fix ==="
grep '"birth_method"' lineage_fix_test/individuals.json | sort | uniq -c
echo "=== Expected: Should see crossover, mutation, and initial ==="

# Check parent-child relationships
echo "=== Parent-Child Relationships ==="
grep '"parents"' lineage_fix_test/individuals.json | head -5
echo "=== Expected: Should see non-empty parents arrays ==="
```

**Success Criteria**:
- See "crossover" and "mutation" birth methods (not just "initial")
- See non-empty parents arrays in individuals.json
- Lineage depth > 0 in lineage_summary.json

### **1.2 Fix Configuration Directory Naming** (2-3 hours)
**Confidence**: 95% - Clear evidence of hardcoded paths vs. configuration

#### **Understanding the Problem** (15 minutes)
- Configuration specifies: `lineage_output_dir: "lineage_comprehensive"`
- Actual directory created: `lineage/`
- System ignores user configuration settings

#### **Step 1: Find Directory Creation Logic** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Find where lineage directory is created
grep -r "lineage.*dir\|lineage.*path" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
grep -r "mkdir\|makedirs" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -A 3 -B 3

# Look for hardcoded "lineage" strings
grep -r '"lineage"' image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
grep -r "'lineage'" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Find output directory creation logic
grep -r "output.*dir\|diagnostics.*dir" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
```

**What to find**:
- Where `lineage/` directory name is hardcoded
- How configuration values should be used instead
- If other directories have similar problems

#### **Step 2: Locate Configuration Loading** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Find configuration loading and usage
grep -r "lineage_output_dir" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 3 -B 3
grep -r "diagnostics_output_dir" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 3 -B 3

# Check configuration structure
cat image_collage/config/settings.py  # or wherever config is defined
```

**Key questions**:
- How is configuration accessed? `config.lineage_output_dir`?
- Where is configuration supposed to be used but isn't?

#### **Step 3: Fix Directory Creation** (60 minutes)

**Typical fix pattern**:
```python
# BEFORE (hardcoded):
lineage_dir = os.path.join(output_dir, "lineage")

# AFTER (using configuration):
lineage_dir = os.path.join(output_dir, config.lineage_output_dir)
```

**Files likely to need changes**:
- Lineage directory creation logic
- Diagnostics directory creation logic
- Any other output directory creation

#### **Step 4: Test Configuration Fix** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Test with custom directory names
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ config_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 3 \
  --track-lineage custom_lineage_test/ \
  --diagnostics custom_diagnostics_test/

# Verify correct directory names used
echo "=== Directory Names After Fix ==="
ls -d output_*/custom_*
echo "=== Expected: Should see custom_lineage_test and custom_diagnostics_test ==="
```

### **1.3 Fix Dashboard Alert Threshold Calibration** (2-3 hours)
**Confidence**: 90% - Statistical problem with clear data to analyze

#### **Understanding the Problem** (15 minutes)
- 49 warnings out of 50 monitored generations (98% false positive rate)
- Alert type: "Very low fitness variance"
- Current threshold: 0.001 (too sensitive for normal evolution)

#### **Step 1: Analyze Actual Fitness Variance Data** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Extract fitness variance from the CSV data
cut -d',' -f13 output_20250920_195522/diagnostics_comprehensive/generation_data.csv | tail -n +2 > fitness_variance.dat

# Calculate statistics
python3 -c "
import numpy as np
data = np.loadtxt('fitness_variance.dat')
print(f'Fitness Variance Statistics:')
print(f'Mean: {np.mean(data):.6f}')
print(f'Median: {np.median(data):.6f}')
print(f'95th percentile: {np.percentile(data, 95):.6f}')
print(f'99th percentile: {np.percentile(data, 99):.6f}')
print(f'Current threshold: 0.001')
print(f'Percent below current threshold: {100 * np.mean(data < 0.001):.1f}%')
"
```

**Expected findings**:
- Most normal evolution has fitness variance below 0.001
- Threshold should be set much lower (maybe 0.00001) to catch real problems

#### **Step 2: Find Alert Threshold Configuration** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Find alert threshold settings
grep -r "0\.001\|low_fitness_variance" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
grep -r "alert.*threshold\|threshold.*alert" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Find dashboard configuration
grep -r "dashboard.*config\|alert.*config" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
```

#### **Step 3: Set Appropriate Thresholds** (60 minutes)

**Calibration approach**:
```python
# Use 1st percentile as warning threshold (1% false positive rate)
# Use 0.1st percentile as critical threshold (0.1% false positive rate)

new_warning_threshold = np.percentile(data, 1)    # ~99% specificity
new_critical_threshold = np.percentile(data, 0.1)  # ~99.9% specificity
```

**Update configuration files or alert logic with new thresholds**

#### **Step 4: Test Alert Calibration** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Test with historical data or new run
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ alert_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 10 \
  --verbose

# Check alert frequency in output
grep -i "warning\|alert" alert_test.log | wc -l
echo "=== Expected: Should see 0-1 alerts instead of 9-10 ==="
```

### **1.4 Fix Aspect Ratio and Grid Orientation** (2-3 hours)
**Confidence**: 90% - Clear evidence of grid/image dimension mismatch

#### **Understanding the Problem** (15 minutes)
- Configuration specifies: 30×40 grid with 32×32 tiles
- Expected output: 960×1280 pixels (portrait to match target)
- Actual output: 1280×960 pixels (landscape - rotated/transposed)
- Target image: 3072×4080 (3:4 portrait) → Output: 4:3 landscape

#### **Step 1: Find Grid Dimension Processing Logic** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Find where grid dimensions are processed
grep -r "grid_size\|grid.*dimension" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5 -B 5

# Look for image dimension calculation
grep -r "output.*dimension\|dimension.*output" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
grep -r "width.*height\|height.*width" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Find tile size multiplication logic
grep -r "tile_size.*grid\|grid.*tile_size" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 3
```

**What to find**:
- Where `grid_size: [30, 40]` is interpreted as width×height vs. height×width
- How output image dimensions are calculated from grid and tile size
- If there's automatic rotation or aspect ratio adjustment

#### **Step 2: Locate Image Creation and Rendering** (45 minutes)
```bash
# Find image rendering/creation code
find image_collage/ -name "*render*" -o -name "*output*" | head -10
grep -r "PIL\|Image\|create.*image" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5

# Look for dimension assignment
grep -r "1280.*960\|960.*1280" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
grep -r "width.*=\|height.*=" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
```

**Key questions**:
- Is grid_size [30, 40] being interpreted as [width, height] or [height, width]?
- Where are final image dimensions determined?
- Is there automatic aspect ratio matching or rotation logic?

#### **Step 3: Diagnose Grid Interpretation Issue** (60 minutes)

**Typical grid interpretation problems**:

**Problem 1: Grid size array interpretation**
```python
# WRONG: Inconsistent interpretation
grid_size = [30, 40]  # Config says [width, height]
width = grid_size[1] * tile_size[0]   # Uses index 1 for width
height = grid_size[0] * tile_size[1]  # Uses index 0 for height
# Results in: width=40*32=1280, height=30*32=960

# RIGHT: Consistent interpretation
grid_size = [30, 40]  # [width, height]
width = grid_size[0] * tile_size[0]   # 30*32 = 960
height = grid_size[1] * tile_size[1]  # 40*32 = 1280
```

**Problem 2: Automatic aspect ratio adjustment**
```python
# WRONG: System rotates to match some default orientation
if target_aspect_ratio > 1.0:  # Portrait target
    output_width, output_height = output_height, output_width  # Force landscape

# RIGHT: Preserve configured grid orientation
# Don't automatically rotate based on target aspect ratio
```

#### **Step 4: Fix Grid Dimension Logic** (30 minutes)

**Fix approach depends on root cause**:

**If grid interpretation is wrong**:
```python
# Ensure consistent [width, height] interpretation throughout
def calculate_output_dimensions(grid_size, tile_size):
    width = grid_size[0] * tile_size[0]   # grid_width * tile_width
    height = grid_size[1] * tile_size[1]  # grid_height * tile_height
    return width, height
```

**If automatic rotation is occurring**:
```python
# Remove automatic aspect ratio adjustment
# Let user control orientation through grid configuration
def create_output_image(grid_size, tile_size):
    # Don't rotate based on target image aspect ratio
    width, height = calculate_output_dimensions(grid_size, tile_size)
    return Image.new('RGB', (width, height))
```

#### **Step 5: Test Aspect Ratio Fix** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Test with same configuration
image-collage generate ../Galapagos_2025/SeaLion_Pose.jpg sources/ aspect_test.png \
  --grid-size 30 40 \
  --verbose

# Verify output dimensions
file aspect_test.png
echo "=== Expected: 960x1280 pixels (portrait to match 30x40 grid) ==="

# Check if target aspect ratio is preserved in interpretation
echo "=== Target: 3:4 portrait, Grid: 30x40, Output should be portrait ==="
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Output dimensions match expected: 960×1280 pixels
- Grid orientation preserved: portrait grid → portrait output
- No automatic rotation overriding user configuration

### **1.5 Fix Genetic Algorithm Representation vs. Rendering Coordinate System** (3-4 hours)
**Confidence**: 85% - Clear visual evidence of systematic coordinate mismatch

#### **Understanding the Problem** (20 minutes)
- **Visual Evidence**: Sea lion shifted right and up from original position
- **Pattern**: Lower-left in original → Upper-center/right in collage
- **Suspected Issue**: 180° rotation effect from coordinate system mismatch
- **GA Fitness**: Good scores (0.293→0.178) suggest GA works correctly within its coordinate system
- **Root Cause**: Bridge between GA representation and image rendering uses different conventions

#### **Step 1: Trace Data Flow from GA to Image** (90 minutes)
```bash
# Find the critical bridge code between GA and rendering
grep -r "individual.*render\|render.*individual" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 10 -B 5
grep -r "grid.*image\|image.*grid" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5

# Look for genetic algorithm individual to grid conversion
grep -r "individual.*grid\|genome.*grid" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 10
grep -r "population.*grid\|grid.*population" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Find image creation from grid/tiles
find image_collage/ -name "*render*" -o -name "*output*" -o -name "*image*" | head -10
grep -r "create.*image\|Image\.new" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5
```

**What to find**:
- Function that converts GA individual (1D array) to 2D grid
- Function that converts 2D grid to final image
- How array indices map to image coordinates

#### **Step 2: Analyze Array Indexing Patterns** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Look for potential row/col vs x/y confusion
grep -r "grid\[.*\]\[.*\]" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 3 -B 3
grep -r "row.*col\|col.*row" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5
grep -r "width.*height\|height.*width" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Check for coordinate transformation functions
grep -r "position.*index\|index.*position" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5
grep -r "x.*y\|coordinate" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 3
```

**Key patterns to identify**:
- `grid[row][col]` vs `grid[col][row]` usage
- Array indexing: `array[y * width + x]` vs `array[x * height + y]`
- Coordinate origin assumptions (top-left vs bottom-left)

#### **Step 3: Identify the Specific Mismatch** (45 minutes)

**Common coordinate system mismatches**:

**Mismatch Type 1: Row-major vs Column-major**
```python
# GA REPRESENTATION: Row-major storage
individual = [tile1, tile2, ..., tile1200]  # 30x40 = 1200 tiles
# Stored as: row0[col0,col1,...,col29], row1[col0,col1,...], ...

# RENDERER: Column-major interpretation
for col in range(width):
    for row in range(height):
        tile = individual[col * height + row]  # WRONG: should be row * width + col
        place_tile_at(row, col, tile)
# RESULT: 90° rotation
```

**Mismatch Type 2: Grid origin confusion**
```python
# GA: Top-left origin (image convention)
for row in range(height):
    for col in range(width):
        index = row * width + col

# RENDERER: Bottom-left origin (math convention)
for row in range(height):
    for col in range(width):
        image_row = height - 1 - row  # Flip vertically
        place_tile_at(image_row, col, tiles[row][col])
# RESULT: Vertical flip
```

**Mismatch Type 3: Dimension interpretation**
```python
# GA: grid_size = [30, 40] interpreted as [width=30, height=40]
individual_length = 30 * 40  # Creates 1200-gene individual

# RENDERER: grid_size = [30, 40] interpreted as [height=30, width=40]
for row in range(30):  # height
    for col in range(40):  # width
        # Wrong dimensions cause coordinate scrambling
# RESULT: Transpose + distortion
```

#### **Step 4: Implement Coordinate System Fix** (60 minutes)

**Fix approach depends on identified mismatch**:

**For row-major/column-major mismatch**:
```python
# UNIFIED APPROACH: Ensure consistent interpretation
def individual_to_grid(individual, grid_width, grid_height):
    """Convert 1D individual to 2D grid with consistent row-major ordering"""
    grid = []
    for row in range(grid_height):
        row_tiles = []
        for col in range(grid_width):
            index = row * grid_width + col  # Consistent row-major
            row_tiles.append(individual[index])
        grid.append(row_tiles)
    return grid

def grid_to_image(grid, tile_size):
    """Convert 2D grid to image with same coordinate convention"""
    height, width = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    image = Image.new('RGB', (width * tile_size[0], height * tile_size[1]))

    for row in range(height):
        for col in range(width):
            tile = grid[row][col]
            # Place tile at consistent position
            x = col * tile_size[0]
            y = row * tile_size[1]  # Same row interpretation
            image.paste(tile, (x, y))
    return image
```

**For origin mismatch**:
```python
# CONSISTENT ORIGIN: Use top-left throughout
# Remove any bottom-left origin conversions in renderer
# Ensure GA and renderer use same coordinate system
```

#### **Step 5: Test Coordinate System Fix** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Test with same target image
image-collage generate ../Galapagos_2025/SeaLion_Pose.jpg sources/ coordinate_fix_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 10 \
  --verbose

# Visual comparison test
echo "=== Position Accuracy Test ==="
echo "Original: Sea lion in lower-left quadrant"
echo "Fixed collage: Sea lion should be in lower-left quadrant"

# Create side-by-side comparison
convert ../Galapagos_2025/SeaLion_Pose.jpg coordinate_fix_test.png +append position_comparison.jpg
echo "Check position_comparison.jpg for sea lion position accuracy"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Sea lion positioned in same relative location as original
- No systematic horizontal or vertical shifts
- Subject features align spatially with target image
- Visual comparison shows accurate positional mapping

#### **Step 6: Verify Fix Doesn't Break Fitness Evaluation** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Ensure fitness scores remain good after coordinate fix
grep "Fitness" coordinate_fix_test.log | tail -5
echo "=== Expected: Fitness should still improve during evolution ==="
echo "=== Expected: Final fitness should be similar to previous runs ==="
```

**Critical validation**: Fix must preserve GA optimization capability while correcting spatial accuracy.

## ⚙️ **PHASE 2: MEDIUM-CONFIDENCE PERFORMANCE ISSUES** (14-22 hours)

### **2.1 Fix LRU Cache Performance** (6-10 hours)
**Confidence**: 70-80% - Multiple possible root causes, but cache concept is straightforward

#### **Understanding the Problem** (30 minutes)
The cache should provide dramatic speedup:
- **Expected**: 62s → 20s per generation after cache warmup
- **Actual**: Flat 62s per generation for 490 generations
- **Impact**: 3x slower than expected performance

**Possible root causes**:
1. Cache not being used at all (code bypasses cache)
2. Cache size too small (constant cache eviction)
3. Cache key collisions (cache misses due to poor key design)
4. Cache implementation fundamentally broken

#### **Step 1: Verify Cache Implementation Exists** (90 minutes)
```bash
# Find cache implementation
find image_collage/ -name "*cache*" -type f
ls -la image_collage/cache/

# Look for cache usage in preprocessing
grep -r "cache\|lru\|LRU" image_collage/preprocessing/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5 -B 5
grep -r "cache\|lru\|LRU" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n | head -20

# Check if cache is imported and used
grep -r "import.*cache\|from.*cache" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
```

**What to find**:
- Cache implementation files
- Where cache should be used (image loading, feature extraction)
- If cache is actually imported and called

#### **Step 2: Add Cache Performance Monitoring** (2-3 hours)

**Add logging to cache operations**:
```python
# Add cache hit/miss tracking
class CacheMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hits = 0
        self.misses = 0
        self.start_time = time.time()

    def log_hit(self):
        self.hits += 1
        if (self.hits + self.misses) % 100 == 0:
            hit_rate = self.hits / (self.hits + self.misses)
            print(f"Cache hit rate: {hit_rate:.3f} ({self.hits}/{self.hits + self.misses})")

    def log_miss(self):
        self.misses += 1

# Instrument cache get/set operations
def cached_get(key):
    if key in cache:
        cache_monitor.log_hit()
        return cache[key]
    else:
        cache_monitor.log_miss()
        return None
```

#### **Step 3: Test Cache Performance with Monitoring** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Run test with cache monitoring
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ cache_monitor_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 10 \
  --verbose 2>&1 | tee cache_monitor.log

# Analyze cache performance
echo "=== Cache Hit Rate Analysis ==="
grep "Cache hit rate" cache_monitor.log
echo "=== Expected: Should see increasing hit rate over generations ==="

# Analyze timing improvements
echo "=== Timing Analysis ==="
grep "Runtime:" cache_monitor.log
echo "=== Expected: Should see decreasing runtime as hit rate increases ==="
```

#### **Step 4: Diagnose and Fix Cache Issues** (2-4 hours)

**Common cache problems and solutions**:

**Problem 1: Cache not being used**
```bash
# Check if cache functions are actually called
# Add print statements to cache get/set operations
# Verify cache is initialized in main execution path
```

**Problem 2: Cache size too small**
```python
# Calculate required cache size
num_images = 500
tile_size = 32 * 32
processing_overhead = 4  # estimate 4x overhead for features
required_mb = num_images * tile_size * processing_overhead * 4 / (1024*1024)  # 4 bytes per pixel

print(f"Required cache size: ~{required_mb:.0f}MB")
print(f"Configured cache size: 16384MB")  # from config

# If required > configured, increase cache size
# If required << configured, investigate cache key issues
```

**Problem 3: Cache key collisions or invalidation**
```python
# Check cache key generation
# Ensure keys are unique and stable
# Verify cache isn't being cleared unnecessarily
```

#### **Step 5: Validate Cache Fix** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Test fixed cache performance
time image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ cache_fixed_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 15 \
  --verbose 2>&1 | tee cache_fixed.log

# Verify performance improvement
echo "=== Performance After Cache Fix ==="
grep "Runtime:" cache_fixed.log | tail -10
echo "=== Expected: Should see ~20-30s per generation after generation 3-5 ==="

# Compare with baseline
./compare_performance.sh cache_test.log cache_fixed.log
```

### **2.2 Fix Island Model Migration System** (8-12 hours)
**Confidence**: 70-80% - Depends on whether island model is implemented or just configured

#### **Understanding the Problem** (30 minutes)
Island model should manage multiple populations with migration:
- **Configuration**: 3 islands, migrate every 20 generations at 0.1 rate
- **Expected**: 25 migration opportunities (500 generations / 20)
- **Actual**: 0 migration events recorded

**Possible root causes**:
1. Island model not implemented (just configuration exists)
2. Migration interval calculation wrong
3. Migration rate condition never met
4. Islands not actually separate populations

#### **Step 1: Verify Island Model Implementation** (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Find island model implementation
find image_collage/ -name "*island*" -type f
grep -r "class.*Island\|Island.*class" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Look for island-related functions
grep -r "def.*island\|def.*migrat" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 10

# Check if islands are used in main evolution
grep -r "island" image_collage/core/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5 -B 5
```

**Key questions**:
- Does island model implementation exist?
- Are islands actually created and managed separately?
- Is island model integrated into main evolution loop?

#### **Step 2: Add Island Model Debug Logging** (2-3 hours)

**Add extensive logging to understand island behavior**:
```python
# In island model or main evolution loop:
def debug_island_state(generation, islands):
    print(f"Generation {generation}:")
    for i, island in enumerate(islands):
        print(f"  Island {i}: {len(island)} individuals, best fitness: {max(island.fitness):.4f}")

    # Check migration trigger
    if generation % migration_interval == 0:
        print(f"  Migration trigger: generation {generation} is multiple of {migration_interval}")
        migration_chance = random.random()
        print(f"  Migration chance: {migration_chance:.3f} vs threshold {migration_rate}")
        if migration_chance < migration_rate:
            print(f"  MIGRATION SHOULD OCCUR")
        else:
            print(f"  No migration (chance too low)")
    else:
        print(f"  No migration trigger (generation {generation} % {migration_interval} = {generation % migration_interval})")
```

#### **Step 3: Test Island Model with Debug Logging** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Run test with island model debugging
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ island_debug_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 25 \
  --verbose 2>&1 | tee island_debug.log

# Analyze island behavior
echo "=== Island Debug Analysis ==="
grep -i "island\|migrat" island_debug.log
echo "=== Expected: Should see island creation and migration triggers ==="

# Check migration events
cat output_*/lineage/migration_events.json
echo "=== Expected: Should see at least 1 migration event ==="
```

#### **Step 4: Fix Island Model Issues** (3-5 hours)

**Common island model problems and solutions**:

**Problem 1: Migration interval calculation**
```python
# WRONG: Migration never triggers
if generation % migration_interval != 0:
    # Migration logic never reached

# RIGHT: Migration triggers correctly
if generation % migration_interval == 0 and generation > 0:
    # Migration logic
```

**Problem 2: Migration rate condition**
```python
# WRONG: Condition never met
if random.random() > migration_rate:  # Should be <
    # Migration logic

# RIGHT: Migration rate works correctly
if random.random() < migration_rate:
    # Migration logic
```

**Problem 3: Islands not actually separate**
```python
# WRONG: All islands share same population
islands = [population, population, population]  # Same reference

# RIGHT: Islands have separate populations
islands = [population.copy() for _ in range(num_islands)]
```

**Problem 4: Migration not recorded in lineage**
```python
# ADD: Record migration events for lineage tracking
def migrate_individual(individual, from_island, to_island):
    # Perform migration
    move_individual(individual, from_island, to_island)

    # Record migration event
    if lineage_tracker:
        lineage_tracker.record_migration(
            individual=individual,
            from_island=from_island,
            to_island=to_island,
            generation=current_generation
        )
```

#### **Step 5: Validate Island Model Fix** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Test fixed island model
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ island_fixed_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 25 \
  --verbose 2>&1 | tee island_fixed.log

# Verify migration events
echo "=== Migration Events After Fix ==="
cat output_*/lineage/migration_events.json | jq length
echo "=== Expected: Should see 1-2 migration events ==="

# Check island behavior in logs
grep -i "migration.*occur\|island.*migrat" island_fixed.log
```

## 🔬 **PHASE 3: LOW-CONFIDENCE COMPLEX FEATURES** (22-30 hours)

### **3.1 Fix Component Tracking System** (12-16 hours)
**Confidence**: 50-60% - Unclear what's implemented vs. what needs to be built

#### **Understanding the Problem** (45 minutes)
Component tracking should analyze individual fitness components:
- **Configuration**: `enable_component_tracking: true`, `track_component_inheritance: true`
- **Expected**: 3 component visualizations showing fitness evolution by component
- **Actual**: 0 component visualizations generated

**Possible root causes**:
1. Component tracking not implemented (just configuration)
2. Component data collected but visualizations not generated
3. Component tracking exists but not integrated with lineage system

#### **Step 1: Research Component Tracking Design** (3-4 hours)
```bash
# Find component tracking implementation
grep -r "component.*track\|track.*component" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 10
grep -r "fitness.*component\|component.*fitness" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Look for component-related data structures
grep -r "color.*fitness\|texture.*fitness\|edge.*fitness" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Check lineage system for component support
grep -r "component" image_collage/lineage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5
```

**Understanding needed**:
- How are fitness components currently calculated?
- Should component tracking record per-individual component scores?
- How should component inheritance work during crossover/mutation?

#### **Step 2: Examine Fitness Component Architecture** (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Study fitness evaluation system
cat image_collage/fitness/evaluator.py  # Look for component breakdown

# Find where fitness components are calculated
grep -r "color.*weight\|texture.*weight\|luminance.*weight" image_collage/ -A 10 -B 5

# Check if components are already tracked individually
head -20 output_20250920_195522/diagnostics_comprehensive/generation_data.csv
```

**Key questions**:
- Are fitness components already calculated separately?
- Are component scores available per individual?
- What additional tracking needs to be implemented?

#### **Step 3: Design Component Tracking Implementation** (2-3 hours)

**If fitness components aren't tracked per individual:**
```python
# Need to modify fitness evaluation to track components
class IndividualFitness:
    def __init__(self, total_fitness, components):
        self.total = total_fitness
        self.color = components['color']
        self.luminance = components['luminance']
        self.texture = components['texture']
        self.edges = components['edges']

# Modify fitness evaluation to return component breakdown
def evaluate_fitness(individual):
    color_score = evaluate_color_fitness(individual)
    luminance_score = evaluate_luminance_fitness(individual)
    texture_score = evaluate_texture_fitness(individual)
    edges_score = evaluate_edges_fitness(individual)

    total = (color_score * color_weight +
             luminance_score * luminance_weight +
             texture_score * texture_weight +
             edges_score * edges_weight)

    return IndividualFitness(total, {
        'color': color_score,
        'luminance': luminance_score,
        'texture': texture_score,
        'edges': edges_score
    })
```

**If component tracking needs integration with lineage:**
```python
# Add component tracking to lineage births
def record_birth_with_components(individual, parents, method):
    # Record normal birth
    lineage_tracker.record_birth(individual, parents, method)

    # Record component inheritance
    if len(parents) == 2:  # Crossover
        # Track how components were inherited from parents
        component_tracker.record_crossover_inheritance(
            child=individual,
            parent1=parents[0],
            parent2=parents[1]
        )
    elif len(parents) == 1:  # Mutation
        # Track how components changed in mutation
        component_tracker.record_mutation_change(
            original=parents[0],
            mutated=individual
        )
```

#### **Step 4: Implement Component Tracking** (4-6 hours)

**Implementation will depend on findings from Steps 1-3:**

**Scenario A: Extend existing fitness evaluation**
- Modify fitness evaluator to return component breakdown
- Store component scores with each individual
- Add component tracking to genetic operations

**Scenario B: Build component tracking from scratch**
- Create component tracking data structures
- Integrate with existing fitness evaluation
- Add lineage integration for inheritance tracking

**Scenario C: Fix broken component visualization**
- Component tracking exists but visualization generation broken
- Debug visualization pipeline
- Fix component plot generation

#### **Step 5: Test Component Tracking** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Test component tracking implementation
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ component_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 10 \
  --track-lineage component_lineage/ \
  --verbose

# Check for component visualizations
echo "=== Component Visualizations ==="
ls component_lineage/*component*.png
echo "=== Expected: Should see 3 component tracking plots ==="

# Check component data in lineage files
echo "=== Component Data ==="
grep -i "component" component_lineage/*.json | head -5
```

### **3.2 Fix Intelligent Restart System** (10-14 hours)
**Confidence**: 50-60% - Complex feature with potential system interactions

#### **Understanding the Problem** (45 minutes)
Intelligent restart should restart population during stagnation:
- **Configuration**: 60 generation stagnation threshold, 40 generation restart threshold
- **Evidence**: Fitness plateau for 30+ generations (90-120, 170-270)
- **Actual**: No restart events detected in data

**Possible root causes**:
1. Stagnation detection logic broken
2. Restart conditions never met
3. Restart implementation missing
4. Restart system disabled or not integrated

#### **Step 1: Locate Restart System Implementation** (3-4 hours)
```bash
# Find restart system files
find image_collage/ -name "*restart*" -type f
grep -r "restart\|stagnation" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 5

# Look for restart logic in genetic algorithm
grep -r "stagnation.*threshold\|restart.*threshold" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n -A 10

# Check configuration usage
grep -r "restart.*stagnation\|stagnation.*restart" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n
```

**Key questions**:
- Does restart system implementation exist?
- How is stagnation detected?
- Where should restart logic be triggered?

#### **Step 2: Analyze Stagnation Detection Logic** (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Look for fitness improvement tracking
grep -r "generations.*without.*improvement\|improvement.*generation" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -n

# Find fitness history tracking
grep -r "fitness.*history\|best.*fitness.*track" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -A 10

# Check if stagnation is detected but restart not triggered
grep -r "stagnation.*detect\|detect.*stagnation" image_collage/ --include="*.py" -A 10
```

#### **Step 3: Add Restart System Debug Logging** (2-3 hours)
```python
# Add comprehensive restart debugging
def debug_restart_system(generation, fitness_history, config):
    current_best = fitness_history[-1]

    # Find generations since last improvement
    generations_without_improvement = 0
    for i in range(len(fitness_history) - 1, 0, -1):
        if fitness_history[i] >= fitness_history[i-1]:
            generations_without_improvement += 1
        else:
            break

    print(f"Generation {generation}:")
    print(f"  Current best fitness: {current_best:.6f}")
    print(f"  Generations without improvement: {generations_without_improvement}")
    print(f"  Stagnation threshold: {config.restart_stagnation_threshold}")

    if generations_without_improvement >= config.restart_stagnation_threshold:
        print(f"  STAGNATION DETECTED - RESTART SHOULD OCCUR")
        return True
    else:
        print(f"  No stagnation (need {config.restart_stagnation_threshold - generations_without_improvement} more)")
        return False
```

#### **Step 4: Test Restart Detection Logic** (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Create test scenario with forced stagnation
# Modify test to plateau fitness artificially to trigger restart

# Run test with restart debugging
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ restart_debug_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 70 \  # Enough to trigger restart
  --verbose 2>&1 | tee restart_debug.log

# Analyze restart behavior
echo "=== Restart Debug Analysis ==="
grep -i "stagnation\|restart" restart_debug.log
echo "=== Expected: Should see stagnation detection and restart events ==="
```

#### **Step 5: Implement or Fix Restart Logic** (3-5 hours)

**Typical restart implementation**:
```python
def intelligent_restart(population, fitness_history, config):
    # Check if restart conditions met
    if should_restart(fitness_history, config):
        print(f"Triggering intelligent restart at generation {current_generation}")

        # Preserve elite individuals
        elite_count = int(len(population) * config.restart_elite_preservation)
        elite_individuals = sorted(population, key=lambda x: x.fitness, reverse=True)[:elite_count]

        # Create new random individuals for rest of population
        new_individuals = generate_random_population(len(population) - elite_count)

        # Combine elite and new individuals
        new_population = elite_individuals + new_individuals

        # Record restart event
        if lineage_tracker:
            lineage_tracker.record_restart_event(
                generation=current_generation,
                elite_preserved=elite_count,
                new_individuals=len(new_individuals)
            )

        return new_population

    return population  # No restart needed
```

#### **Step 6: Validate Restart System** (60 minutes)
```bash
# Test restart system with longer run
image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ restart_test.png \
  --preset demo --generations 80 \
  --verbose 2>&1 | tee restart_test.log

# Check for restart events
echo "=== Restart Events ==="
grep -i "restart.*trigger\|restart.*occur" restart_test.log
echo "=== Expected: Should see at least 1 restart event ==="

# Verify restart improves fitness
echo "=== Fitness After Restart ==="
grep "Fitness.*=" restart_test.log | tail -20
echo "=== Expected: Should see fitness improvement after restart ==="
```

### **4.1 Comprehensive Integration Testing** (3 hours)
**Objective**: Test all fixed systems working together

#### **Step 1: Full System Test** (2 hours)
```bash

### **4.2 Performance Benchmarking** (2 hours)
**Objective**: Verify performance improvements achieved

#### **Step 1: Performance Comparison Test** (90 minutes)
```bash
# Baseline performance test (with fixes)
echo "=== Performance Benchmark Test ==="
time image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ benchmark_test.png \
  --preset balanced --generations 20 \

### **4.3 Documentation and Maintenance** (60 minutes)
**Objective**: Document fixes and establish maintenance procedures

#### **Step 1: Document Successful Fixes** (30 minutes)
```bash
# Create fix summary document
cat > DEBUGGING_RESULTS.md << 'EOF'
# Debugging Results Summary

## Fixed Systems
- [x] Lineage Tracking: Integration restored, birth methods working
- [x] Configuration: Directory naming now respects user settings
- [x] Dashboard Alerts: Threshold calibrated to <5% false positive rate
- [x] LRU Cache: Performance improvement achieved (Xx faster)
- [x] Island Model: Migration events now occurring
- [x] Component Tracking: All 3 visualizations generated
- [x] Restart System: Population restart during stagnation

## Performance Improvements
- Cache speedup: [X.X]x faster after warmup
- Alert accuracy: 98% → [X]% false positive rate
- Lineage completeness: 0% → 100% birth tracking

## Validation Metrics
- Lineage visualizations: 16/16 generated
- Migration events: [X] events in test runs
- Component tracking: 3/3 visualizations
- Performance: [XX]s → [XX]s per generation after warmup

## Maintenance Notes
- Monitor cache hit rates in future runs
- Watch for alert threshold effectiveness
- Verify lineage tracking continues working
- Check restart system triggers appropriately

## 🚨 **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **If Debugging Breaks Existing Functionality**
1. **Immediate rollback**:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1  # or specific working commit
   ```

2. **Test baseline functionality**:
   ```bash
   image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ emergency_test.png --preset demo --generations 3
   ```

3. **Identify what broke**:
   - Compare error messages
   - Check if core GA still works
   - Verify diagnostics still generate

4. **Resume from known working state**:
   - Apply fixes incrementally
   - Test after each change
   - Keep working systems intact

### **If Performance Gets Significantly Worse**
1. **Disable new features temporarily**:
   ```bash
   # Test without advanced features
   image-collage generate target.jpg sources/ perf_test.png --preset demo --generations 5
   ```

2. **Profile specific operations**:
   - Add timing to cache operations
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Check for infinite loops or excessive computation

3. **Compare with baseline timing**:
   - Use original output_20250920_195522 as reference
   - Expect similar or better performance

### **Critical Files to Monitor During Debugging**
- `output_*/lineage/individuals.json` - Lineage tracking health
- `output_*/lineage/migration_events.json` - Island model status
- `output_*/diagnostics_*/generation_data.csv` - Performance trends
- `output_*/config.yaml` - Configuration verification
- `nohup.out` or verbose output - Runtime behavior and errors

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Critical Success Criteria** (Must achieve):
- **Lineage tracking**: Birth methods include "crossover" and "mutation" (not just "initial")
- **Cache performance**: <40s per generation after generation 5-10 (vs. 62s baseline)
- **Configuration**: Correct directory names used (user settings respected)
- **System stability**: All fixes maintain existing working functionality

### **Advanced Success Criteria** (Should achieve):
- **Island model**: >0 migration events in 25+ generation runs
- **Component tracking**: All 3 component visualizations generated
- **Restart system**: Population restart during detected stagnation periods
- **Alert system**: <10% false positive rate for meaningful warnings

### **Excellence Criteria** (Ideal outcomes):
- **Complete lineage suite**: All 16 lineage visualizations generated
- **Performance optimization**: 3x performance improvement with working cache
- **System reliability**: Zero regressions in working systems
- **Maintainability**: Clear documentation and monitoring for future debugging

This comprehensive debugging plan provides systematic approach to restore all failed systems while preserving working functionality. Each phase builds incrementally with clear validation criteria and fallback procedures.
